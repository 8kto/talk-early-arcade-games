# Intro

Recently I discovered a `DX` term - which means Development eXpirience. 
This all is about the stuff behind the code you're writing: physical and software environment, tooling and so on.

I was fascinated by this term, and pleasantly surprised because I've been collecting such tips/tricks/notes and environment adjustments for some time.

      My talk is about configuring your environment, as OS, terminal, profile, IDE. It also contains some tips and notes about useful hotkeys, which are <strong>must-known</strong>, I believe.</p>
